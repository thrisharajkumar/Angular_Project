<!--Validators are rules which an input control has to follow. 
    If the input doesnâ€™t match the rule then the control is said to be invalid.
Angular comes with the small set of prebuilt validators to match the ones we can 
define via standard HTML 5 attributes, namely required, minlength, maxlength and 
pattern which we can access from the Validators class in @angular/forms library.
STEP 1:ng g c signup
STEP 2:app.module.ts->import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
STEP 3:signup.component.ts ->import { Validators } from '@angular/forms';-->

<!--Bootstrap provides a different way to show an error message to the user.

By using Alert component of bootstrap
By using visual feedback for the form controls when they are invalid.-->
